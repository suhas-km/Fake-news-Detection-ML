# Fake-news-Detection-ML
In this project, we have used natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify whether the news is fake or not. Using a benchmark dataset and machine learning models like SVM, Naive-Bayes and Logistic Regression, we are predicting the possibility of the news to be true or false.
